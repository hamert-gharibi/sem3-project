                        Freedom for the individual, equality, respect, tolerance and a strong sense of mutual trust are core values in Denmark. 
                        This is also reflected in the way we organise our workplaces and educate our youth.

                        Danish law guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits discrimination based on gender, race, religious belief or sexual orientation. 
                        A large majority of Danes are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, supported by the Danish state. Nonetheless, most Danes view 
                        the church as a cultural institution and religious discussions are not very predominant in the public debate.

                        <p>
                        Denmark is a family-friendly society where children and their parents enjoy plenty of cultural activities and easy access to nature, 
                        beaches and sports facilities. Danish cities are bicycle-friendly and green. And with Denmarkâ€™s low crime rate, children can roam freely 
                        and even walk themselves to school.
